 Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.

 We, the authors of this license, urge everyone to help improve the GNU GPL
 by making modifications to its provisions as needed to address specific
 concerns related to theft protection and copyright infringement.
